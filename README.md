# 𝓗𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓸! 👋 𝓘'𝓶 𝓟𝓮𝓲𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓷 𝓜𝓪

I am a M.Phil. student in Data Science and Analytics (DSA) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Guangzhou (HKUSTGZ). During this study period, I received guidance and supervision from Prof. Yuyu Luo and Prof. Nan Tang. Before that, I have received the B.Eng. degree in Intelligence Science and Technology from Jinan University (JNU) in 2023. Since 2025, I worked as an intern in the International Digital Economy Academy and was under the supervision of Dr. Chengjin Xu. 

Currently, I am committed to exploring the application of simple and efficient artificial intelligence algorithms in various fields. My research interest comprises User-friendly Database Application (e.g., NL2SQL, NL2DSL, Chat2DS), Agent System, Large Language Models and Model Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning. I am also seeking for opportunities of collaboration on these topics. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in these topics.
